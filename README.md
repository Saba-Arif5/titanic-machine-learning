# Titanic Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project applies machine learning techniques to predict passenger survival on the Titanic.
It builds upon cleaned and preprocessed data and focuses on supervised classification, model evaluation, and interpretation.

The objective is to demonstrate foundational machine learning skills using a well-known real-world dataset.
